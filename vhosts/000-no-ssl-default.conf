# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Drop requests for unknown hosts
#
# If no default server is defined, Apache will use the first found server.
# To prevent host header attacks, or other potential problems when an unknown
# servername is used in a request, it's recommended use en empty virtual host
# as the first loaded one.
#
# (1) In production, only secure hosts should be used (all `no-ssl` disabled).
#     If so, redirect first ANY request to a secure connexion before handling it
#     even if the host is unknown.
